📊 Dataset Analyzer App (Class Imbalance Checker)
🌟 Overview:
The Dataset Analyzer App is a powerful tool designed to help users analyze and visualize the distribution of classes in image datasets, especially for detecting class imbalances. Whether you're working with Kaggle datasets, ZIP archives, or CSV files, this app provides insights into the structure, class distribution, and image counts of your dataset. It offers interactive visualizations to explore the data easily.

🚀 Key Features:
⚖️ Class Imbalance Detection: Automatically checks for class imbalances in your dataset and displays class distribution across different folders or CSV target columns.
📊 Interactive Visualizations: Includes sunburst charts and bar charts to visualize the dataset's structure and class distribution.
🗂️ Flexible Dataset Support: Supports datasets in various formats:
📂 ZIP Archives: Upload and extract image datasets stored in ZIP or TAR.GZ formats.
📑 CSV Files: Process CSV files for class distribution analysis and data exploration.
🖼️ Sample Image Display: Displays random sample images from the dataset for preview.

🔍 Dynamic CSV Analysis: Automatically detects target columns in CSV files, including numeric or string identifiers, and displays the class distribution.

🛠️ How It Works:
📥 Kaggle Dataset Download: Enter the Kaggle dataset name, and the app will download and unzip the dataset to a temporary folder for analysis.
📤 ZIP Archive Upload: Upload a ZIP/TAR.GZ archive containing images. The app will extract and process the images for class distribution.
📂 CSV File Upload: Upload a CSV file containing class labels. The app will identify the target column dynamically and generate a class distribution report.
